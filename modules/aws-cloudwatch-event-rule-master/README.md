We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure.

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies:

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-cloudwatch-event-rule/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
    module "event-rule" {
      source              = "clouddrove/cloudwatch-event-rule/aws"
      version             = "1.0.1"
      name                = "event-rule"
      environment         = "test"
      label_order         = ["environment", "name"]
      description         = "Event Rule."
      schedule_expression = "cron(0/5 * * * ? *)"
      target_id           = "test"
      arn                 = "arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-1:012345678901:function:test"
    }
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| arn | The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the role that is used for target invocation. | `string` | `""` | no |
| description | The description for the rule. | `string` | `""` | no |
| enabled | Enable event. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| event\_pattern | (schedule\_expression isn't specified) Event pattern described a JSON object. See full documentation of CloudWatch Events and Event Patterns for details. | `any` | `null` | no |
| input\_path | The value of the JSONPath that is used for extracting part of the matched event when passing it to the target. | `string` | `""` | no |
| input\_paths | Key value pairs specified in the form of JSONPath (for example, time = $.time) | `map(any)` | `{}` | no |
| input\_template | Template to customize data sent to the target. Must be valid JSON. To send a string value, the string value must include double quotes. Values must be escaped for both JSON and Terraform, | `string` | `""` | no |
| is\_enabled | Whether the rule should be enabled (defaults to true). | `bool` | `true` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| managedby | ManagedBy, eg 'CloudDrove' or 'AnmolNagpal'. | `string` | `"anmol@clouddrove.com"` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| repository | Terraform current module repo | `string` | `"https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-cloudwatch-event-rule"` | no |
| role\_arn | The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the role that is used for target invocation. | `string` | `""` | no |
| schedule\_expression | (if event\_pattern isn't specified) The scheduling expression. For example, cron(0 20 \* \* ? \*) or rate(5 minutes). | `any` | `null` | no |
| target\_id | The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the role that is used for target invocation. | `string` | `""` | no |
| target\_role\_arn | The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to be used for this target when the rule is triggered. Required if ecs\_target is used. | `string` | `""` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| arn | The ARN of the cloudwatch metric alarm. |
| id | The ID of the health check. |
| tags | A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system.

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
